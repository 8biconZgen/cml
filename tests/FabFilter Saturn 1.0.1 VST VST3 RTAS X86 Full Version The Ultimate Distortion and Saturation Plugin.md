## Features of FabFilter Saturn 1.0.1 VST VST3 RTAS X86 Full Version
 
- **16 different distortion styles**: You can choose from a range of high quality distortion models, inspired by the vintage sound of tubes, tape and guitar amps. You can also experiment with three creative distortion styles, which let you smudge, stretch, crush, rectify and clip your sounds in weird and unexpected ways.
- **Multi-band processing**: You can split your signal into up to 6 bands, and apply different distortion styles and settings to each band. You can also adjust the crossover frequencies, solo or mute each band, and use mid/side processing for extra stereo width.
- **Per-band drive, mix, feedback, dynamics, tone and level controls**: You can fine-tune the sound of each band with these parameters. The drive knob controls the amount of distortion applied to the band, while the mix knob controls the dry/wet balance. The feedback knob adds a feedback loop to the band, creating more harmonics and resonance. The dynamics knob controls the compression or expansion applied to the band, while the tone knob controls the brightness or darkness of the band. The level knob controls the output volume of the band.
