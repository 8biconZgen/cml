# Juodos Avys 2010: A Lithuanian Rock Festival with a Twist
 
Juodos Avys (Black Sheep) is an annual rock music festival that takes place in Lithuania since 1992. The festival features local and international bands, as well as various art and cultural activities. But what makes Juodos Avys unique is its theme: every year, the festival chooses a different animal to represent its spirit and identity.
 
In 2010, the festival's theme was "temp", which stands for "temporary". The organizers wanted to emphasize the ephemeral nature of life and art, and to encourage the participants to live in the moment and enjoy the festival experience. The festival's logo was a stylized sheep with a clock face on its body, symbolizing the passing of time.

The festival took place from July 23 to July 25 at the Zarasai aerodrome, a former military airport. The lineup included bands such as Apocalyptica, The Rasmus, Andrius Mamontovas, Biplan, Rebelheart, and many others.

The parade also featured music, dancing, and fireworks.
 
The parade ended at the main stage, where the final concert of the festival was held.
