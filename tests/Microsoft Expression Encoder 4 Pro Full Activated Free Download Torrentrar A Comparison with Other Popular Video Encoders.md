If you are looking for a way to activate Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 or 2013 without a product key, you may need a confirmation ID generator. A confirmation ID is a set of numbers that validates your installation of Office and allows you to use all its features. However, getting a confirmation ID is not easy, as you need to call Microsoft Support and provide them with your activation ID, which is generated by Office when you enter a product key or a trial key. In this article, we will show you how to find a confirmation ID generator for Office 2010 and 2013, and how to use it to activate your Office suite.  A confirmation ID generator is a software tool that can create confirmation IDs for various versions of Office, including Office 2010 and 2013 Professional Plus. These tools are usually based on keygen algorithms that can produce valid confirmation IDs from activation IDs. However, these tools are not official or authorized by Microsoft, and they may contain malware or viruses that can harm your computer. Therefore, we do not recommend using them, and we advise you to purchase a genuine product key from Microsoft or an authorized reseller.  If you still want to use a confirmation ID generator, you need to follow these steps:  1. Download a confirmation ID generator for Office 2010 or 2013 from the internet. You can search for terms like "microsoft office professional plus 2010 confirmation id generator" or "microsoft office professional plus 2013 confirmation id generator" on Google or other search engines. However, be careful about the sources and the files you download, as they may be unsafe or illegal. 2. Install and run the confirmation ID generator on your computer. You may need to disable your antivirus or firewall software before doing so, as they may block or delete the tool. 3. Open MS Office on your computer and enter a product key or a trial key. You can find some product keys online, but they may not work or may be already used by others. You can also use the following product keys for testing purposes only:  - Office 2010 Professional Plus: VYBBJ-TRJPB-QFQRF-QFT4D-H3GVB - Office 2013 Professional Plus: YC7DK-G2NP3-2QQC3-J6H88-GVGXT  4. After entering the product key, you will see an activation wizard that will ask you to activate Office online or by phone. Choose the phone option and click Next. 5. You will see an installation ID on the screen, which is a set of numbers divided into several groups. Copy or write down this installation ID, as you will need it for the next step. 6. Go back to the confirmation ID generator and paste or type the installation ID in the corresponding field. Then click Generate or Crack to create a confirmation ID. 7. Copy or write down the confirmation ID that is displayed by the tool. 8. Go back to the activation wizard and type the confirmation ID in the spaces provided at the bottom of the screen. Then click Next. 9. If the confirmation ID is valid, you will see a message that says "Activation was successful". Click Close and enjoy your activated Office suite.  Note: This method may not work for all versions of Office or all computers. It may also violate Microsoft's terms of service and expose you to legal risks. We do not endorse or support this method in any way, and we are not responsible for any consequences that may arise from using it.
