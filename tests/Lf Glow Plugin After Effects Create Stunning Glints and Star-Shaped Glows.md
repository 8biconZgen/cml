Once you have applied Lf Glow Plugin to a layer, you will see a set of parameters in the Effect Controls panel. These parameters allow you to adjust the basic properties of the glow, such as its color, intensity, falloff, shape, and direction. Here is a brief overview of each parameter:

- Glow Color: This parameter allows you to choose the color of the glow. You can use the color picker or enter a hexadecimal value. You can also use an expression or a color map to control the color dynamically.
- Glow Intensity: This parameter allows you to adjust the brightness of the glow. A higher value will make the glow more visible and saturated, while a lower value will make it more subtle and faded.
- Glow Falloff: This parameter allows you to adjust how quickly the glow fades away from the source. A higher value will make the glow more concentrated and sharp, while a lower value will make it more diffuse and soft.
- Glow Shape: This parameter allows you to choose the shape of the glow. You can choose from four options: Circular, Star, Linear, and Custom. Each option has its own subparameters that allow you to further customize the shape.
- Glow Direction: This parameter allows you to adjust the angle and orientation of the glow. You can use the slider or enter a numerical value in degrees. You can also use an expression or a directional point to control the direction dynamically.

By adjusting these parameters, you can create different types of glow effects for your layer.
