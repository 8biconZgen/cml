For example, you can create a collection object that stores multiple values of the same type, such as prices, volumes, or indicators. You can then use the collection object to perform various operations on the stored values, such as calculating averages, standard deviations, or correlations. You can also create a class object that defines the properties and methods of a custom indicator or strategy, such as inputs, outputs, calculations, and plots. You can then use the class object to instantiate multiple instances of the indicator or strategy with different parameters and settings.
 
## How to create and use Easylanguage objects?
 
To create and use Easylanguage objects, you need to follow some basic steps:

1. Define the object type and name using the keyword `object`
2. Specify the object properties and methods using the keywords `var` and `method`
3. Create an instance of the object using the keyword `new`
4. Access the object properties and methods using the dot operator `.`
5. Delete the object instance using the keyword `delete`

For example, here is how you can create and use a simple collection object that stores three values:
  ```easylanguage // Define the collection object type and name object MyCollection begin   // Specify the collection properties   var: int Count(0); // The number of values in the collection   var: double Value1(0); // The first value in the collection   var: double Value2(0); // The second value in the collection   var: double Value3(0); // The third value in the collection      // Specify the collection methods   method void Add(double v); // A method to add a value to the collection   method double Sum(); // A method to calculate the sum of the values in the collection   method double Average(); // A method to calculate the average of the values in the collection end;  // Define the Add method method void MyCollection.Add(double v) begin   // Increment the count by one   Count = Count + 1;      // Assign the value to the appropriate property based on the count   switch Count   begin     case 1: Value1 = v; break;     case 2: Value2 = v; break;     case 3: Value3 = v; break;     default: Print("The collection is full."); break;   end; end;  // Define the Sum method method double MyCollection.Sum() begin   // Return the sum of the values in the collection   return Value1 + Value2 + Value3; end;  // Define the Average method method double MyCollection.Average() begin   // Return the average of the values in the collection   return Sum() / Count; end;  // Create an instance of the collection object var: MyCollection C;  C = new MyCollection;  // Add some values to the collection C.Add(10); C.Add(20); C.Add(30);  // Print some information about the collection Print("The count is ", C.Count); Print("The sum is ", C.Sum()); Print("The average is ", C.Average());  // Delete the collection instance delete C; ``` 8cf37b1e13
