# Cube Escape: Paradox - Chapter 2: A Mind-Bending Puzzle Game
 
Cube Escape: Paradox - Chapter 2 is the second and final chapter of the tenth installment in the Cube Escape series by Rusty Lake. It is a point-and-click adventure game that combines puzzles, mystery, and surrealism. The game follows detective Dale Vandermeer, who wakes up in a strange room with no memory of his past. He soon realizes that he is trapped in a twisted game orchestrated by his old nemesis, Mr. Crow. To escape the room and recover his memories, Dale must solve increasingly challenging puzzles that span across different realities and timelines.

Some of these secrets are related to the film, while others are related to previous Rusty Lake games. The game also has a lot of references to other media, such as Twin Peaks, Alice in Wonderland, and The Shining.
 
The game is not only a puzzle game, but also a psychological thriller that explores themes such as memory, identity, and reality. The game challenges the player to question their own perception and sanity, as well as the motives and intentions of the characters they encounter. The game also has a dark and twisted sense of humor that adds some comic relief to the otherwise grim atmosphere. The game is not suitable for young children or people who are easily disturbed by violence, gore, or horror.
