If you are a FPGA developer or enthusiast, you may be interested in using Vivado, the design suite software provided by Xilinx. Vivado is a powerful tool that allows you to create, simulate, synthesize, implement, and debug your FPGA designs. However, you may also wonder how to get a license file for Vivado without paying any fees.
 
Fortunately, Xilinx offers a free WebPACK edition of Vivado that supports many FPGA devices, including the popular Artix 7, Kintex 7, and Zynq 7000 families. The WebPACK edition also includes access to some IP cores and the Vitis unified software platform. With the WebPACK edition, you can program your FPGAs for personal, academic, or hobbyist projects.
