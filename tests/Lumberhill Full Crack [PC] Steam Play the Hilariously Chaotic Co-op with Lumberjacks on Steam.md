They inject a substance into a female volunteer, who is revealed to be Mai (Sunny Leone), a simple and innocent girl who wants to help humanity. However, something goes wrong and the lab explodes, killing everyone except Mai.
 
Mai wakes up in a hospital, where she discovers that she has gained superpowers, such as super strength, super speed and flight. She also realizes that she is being hunted by a mysterious organization that wants to capture her and use her for their evil plans. She escapes from the hospital and flies away to India, where she hopes to find a safe place.
 
In India, she meets Raj (Mika Singh), a famous Bollywood singer who is also a secret agent. Raj is assigned to protect Mai from the enemies who are after her. He also falls in love with her and tries to woo her with his songs and charm. Mai is initially confused by Raj's advances, but soon reciprocates his feelings.
 
Meanwhile, the leader of the organization that is chasing Mai is revealed to be Rana (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), a ruthless and cunning villain who wants to use Mai's powers to create an army of superhumans and take over the world. He also has a personal grudge against Raj, who had foiled his previous plans. Rana sends his henchmen to kidnap Mai and bring her to his secret base.
 
Raj follows them and tries to rescue Mai, but he is captured and tortured by Rana. Mai uses her powers to free herself and Raj, and they fight their way out of the base.
