## What is a Wibu Key Dongle?
  
A Wibu Key dongle is a small device that plugs into one of the USB ports of your computer. It contains a unique code that identifies your software licenses and allows you to run the software on that computer. The Wibu Key dongle is used to control and protect the software from piracy and unauthorized use.
  
The Wibu Key dongle is produced by Wibu-Systems, a German company that specializes in software protection and licensing solutions. The Wibu Key dongle is compatible with many interfaces and operating systems, and supports various encryption algorithms and security features.
  
## How Does a Wibu Key Dongle Work?
  
When you install a software that requires a Wibu Key dongle, you also install a driver that communicates with the dongle. The driver checks if the dongle is present and valid, and then sends a request to the dongle for a license. The dongle responds with a license code that matches the software and the computer. The driver then verifies the license code and allows the software to run.
