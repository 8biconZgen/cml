Teofrasto wrote two major treatises on botany: Historia Plantarum (On the History of Plants) and De Causis Plantarum (On the Causes of Plants). In Historia Plantarum, he classified plants according to their morphology, distinguishing between trees, shrubs, herbs and cereals. He also described about 455 plant species, some of which he named himself, and their habitats, properties, uses and cultivation. He also discussed plant anatomy, physiology, reproduction and growth. In De Causis Plantarum, he explored the causes of plant phenomena, such as germination, flowering, fruiting and wilting. He also examined the effects of climate, soil, water, light and human intervention on plants.

Teofrasto was not only a botanist, but also a philosopher who wrote on many topics, such as logic, metaphysics, ethics, politics, rhetoric and poetics. He was a close friend and colleague of Aristotle, and inherited his library and manuscripts when he died.

Teofrasto was also a pioneer in the study of human character and psychology. He wrote a book called On Characters (Peri Charakteron), in which he described thirty different types of personalities, such as the flatterer, the coward, the boor, the superstitious and the miser. He analyzed their motives, habits, speech and behavior in a witty and realistic way. He also gave advice on how to deal with them or avoid them. His work influenced later writers of character sketches, such as La BruyÃ¨re and Theophrastus redivivus .
 
Teofrasto was a respected and influential figure in his time. He was honored by the Athenians with a public funeral and a statue in the botanical garden. His works were widely read and commented on by later scholars and scientists. He was admired for his erudition, his style and his originality. He is regarded as one of the greatest thinkers of antiquity and one of the founders of modern science.
