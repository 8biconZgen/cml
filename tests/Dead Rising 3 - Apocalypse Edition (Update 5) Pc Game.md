The game gives you a lot of freedom and creativity in how you deal with the zombies. You can use almost anything as a weapon, from guns and knives to golf clubs and teddy bears.

You can also use vehicles to mow down zombies, or customize them with weapons and armor. The game features hundreds of unique combo weapons and vehicles to discover and experiment with.
